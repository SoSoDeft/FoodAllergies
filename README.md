Introduction
My wife is allergic to dairy products and we enjoy eating out every once in a while. Eating out involves having the wait staff either go ask the chef what is safe or having to go find a book which lists out all the allergens a meal has. This is time consuming. Wouldn’t it be nice to store the meals you’ve had in the past so you can quickly and easily order what you know that is safe for you to eat?
